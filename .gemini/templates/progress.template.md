# Progress Status

<!--
MAINTENANCE RULES:
1. **Rolling Window**: Keep only the Active Phase and the immediate previous 2 phases in detail.
2. **Summarization**: Collapse older phases into high-level summaries (Goals + Key Outcomes) under "History" or remove if architecturally superseded.
3. **Density**: Focus on architectural shifts, capabilities added, and "Why", not just "What". Avoid listing individual file edits.
4. **Versioning**: Bump version numbers on Phase completion.
